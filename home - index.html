            <p>Hello! My name is Barbara Uribe and i am from Maracay, Venezuela. I like reading, I am passionate about aeronautics and fashion, I am an aeronautical engineering student and I love Formula 1.Since I was little I have been passionate about learning new languages, I am very happy learning, I like to study. My passion for Formula 1 developed thanks to my parents. When I was little I watched Formula 1 with my dad. When I began to understand it, it was inevitable not to feel passion for motor sport. My favorite driver is Ayrton Senna. I consider him to be the best. In history, the best Formula 1 circuit is "Monaco", unique and emblematic, and my current favorite driver is Max Verstappen, I feel very identified with him, as a curious fact my favorite team since I was little is Ferrari. </p>
